## 🐛 Bug Database — 12 Issues Found & Fixed

### BUG-001: PremiumFeature Type Mismatch (CRITICAL)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL  
- **Module:** Premium System  
- **Root Cause:** `usePremium.ts` defined `PremiumFeature` as `"voice_dictation" | "ai_writing" | "ai_style_matcher"` but `PremiumContext.tsx` defined it as 7 different features. `PaywallModal.tsx` used `PremiumContext` version, `Index.tsx` used `usePremium` version.  
- **Impact:** App would crash when passing invalid feature keys to PaywallModal.  
- **Fix:** Unified `usePremium.ts` to use same 7 features as `PremiumContext.tsx`. Updated all `requirePremium()` calls in Index.tsx.  
- **Verification:** 0 TypeScript errors, build passes. ✅

### BUG-002: Missing PWA Icons (MAJOR)
- **Severity:** MAJOR  
- **Module:** PWA  
- **Root Cause:** `manifest.json` referenced `icon-72x72.png`, `icon-96x96.png`, `icon-128x128.png`, `icon-144x144.png`, `icon-384x384.png` but files didn't exist in `public/icons/`.  
- **Impact:** PWA install broken on many Android devices. Chrome would refuse to install the app.  
- **Fix:** Generated all missing icons from the existing 512x512 source image using PIL/Pillow.  
- **Verification:** All 8 icon sizes now present. ✅

### BUG-003: Lovable Tagger in Production Build (MAJOR)
- **Severity:** MAJOR  
- **Module:** Build / Vite  
- **Root Cause:** `vite.config.ts` imported `lovable-tagger` which is a dev tool that injects component IDs into HTML attributes. This bloats the build and potentially exposes component structure.  
- **Impact:** Increased bundle size, unnecessary dev tooling in production, security risk.  
- **Fix:** Removed `componentTagger` from vite.config.ts and `lovable-tagger` from package.json.  
- **Verification:** Clean build, no lovable references. ✅

### BUG-004: @lovable.dev/cloud-auth-js Dependency (MAJOR)
- **Severity:** MAJOR  
- **Module:** Dependencies  
- **Root Cause:** Unused `@lovable.dev/cloud-auth-js` package was still in `package.json`. Integration stub existed but the package was never actually imported in any source file.  
- **Impact:** Unnecessary dependency, increased install size, potential security vulnerabilities.  
- **Fix:** Removed from package.json.  
- **Verification:** `npm install` succeeds without it. ✅

### BUG-005: Wrong Supabase Callback URL in Account Page (MAJOR)
- **Severity:** MAJOR  
- **Module:** Auth / Account Settings  
- **Root Cause:** Account.tsx displayed `https://ievggapvfidhygkhtkug.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` as the Google OAuth redirect URL, but the actual project uses `https://atuxocibsmflgwlwuvm.supabase.co`.  
- **Impact:** Users following setup instructions would configure wrong redirect URL, breaking Google OAuth completely.  
- **Fix:** Changed to correct URL `https://atuxocibsmflgwlwuvm.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.  
- **Verification:** URL now matches .env Supabase URL. ✅

### BUG-006: Textarea Not Auto-Resizing in BlockEditor (MINOR)
- **Severity:** MINOR  
- **Module:** BlockEditor  
- **Root Cause:** Textarea had `rows={1}` and `resize-none` but no auto-height adjustment. Long content would be invisible.  
- **Impact:** Users couldn't see all their text in a block.  
- **Fix:** Added `el.style.height = 'auto'; el.style.height = el.scrollHeight + 'px'` on both ref callback and onChange.  
- **Verification:** Textarea grows with content. ✅

### BUG-007: PDF Export Aspect Ratio Distortion (MAJOR)
- **Severity:** MAJOR  
- **Module:** Export  
- **Root Cause:** `pdf.addImage(imgData, 'PNG', 0, 0, A4_WIDTH_MM, A4_HEIGHT_MM)` always stretched the captured image to fill the entire A4 page, regardless of the actual image aspect ratio.  
- **Impact:** Exported PDFs had distorted/stretched content.  
- **Fix:** Rewrote export engine to calculate proper aspect ratio and center the image on the A4 page. Added error recovery (blank page with error text instead of crash).  
- **Verification:** PDF export maintains correct proportions. ✅

### BUG-008: Slash Commands Not Providing Template Content (MINOR)
- **Severity:** MINOR  
- **Module:** BlockEditor  
- **Root Cause:** `handleSlashSelect` set all new blocks to `{ type, content: '' }` regardless of block type. Users had to figure out what to type for each block type.  
- **Impact:** Templates felt broken — selecting "Table" gave an empty block, "Code" gave empty block, etc.  
- **Fix:** Added template content for all 25+ block types. Code blocks get `// Your code here`, equations get `E = mc^2`, tables get proper headers/rows, etc.  
- **Verification:** Every slash command now produces a working, populated block. ✅

### BUG-009: Missing Block Previews for Most Block Types (MINOR)
- **Severity:** MINOR  
- **Module:** BlockEditor  
- **Root Cause:** Only image, equation, and bookmark blocks had visual previews. All other block types (code, table, mermaid, video, audio, PDF, AI-generated, etc.) had no visual representation.  
- **Impact:** Users couldn't tell what type a block was after creating it.  
- **Fix:** Added visual previews for code (terminal-style), table (rendered HTML table), mermaid (diagram indicator), video/audio/pdf (placeholder cards), AI-generated (purple gradient card), synced (blue badge), table of contents.  
- **Verification:** All 25+ block types have visual representations. ✅

### BUG-010: Large Main Bundle Size (MINOR)
- **Severity:** MINOR  
- **Module:** Build  
- **Root Cause:** SmartEditor was eagerly imported, adding to the main bundle.  
- **Impact:** 1416KB main chunk, slow initial load.  
- **Fix:** Lazy-loaded SmartEditor with `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`. Added `vendor-charts` and `vendor-markdown` manual chunks.  
- **Verification:** Main chunk reduced to 999KB (-30%). ✅

### BUG-011: Index.tsx Using Wrong Premium Feature Keys (CRITICAL)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL  
- **Module:** Premium / Index  
- **Root Cause:** Index.tsx was calling `requirePremium('ai_writing')`, `requirePremium('ai_style_matcher')`, `requirePremium('voice_dictation')` but those keys don't exist in the unified `PremiumFeature` type.  
- **Impact:** TypeScript would have caught this at the `requirePremium` call site, but the old `usePremium.ts` defined those keys, creating inconsistency with `PaywallModal.tsx` which expected different keys.  
- **Fix:** Changed to `requirePremium('ai_text_tools')`, `requirePremium('handwriting_styles')`, `requirePremium('voice_to_notes')`.  
- **Verification:** All premium feature calls now use correct unified keys. ✅

### BUG-012: PDF Export No Error Recovery (CRITICAL)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL  
- **Module:** Export  
- **Root Cause:** If `captureToCanvas` failed for any page, the entire export would crash with an unhandled error.  
- **Impact:** Users would lose their entire export if even one page had a rendering issue.  
- **Fix:** Added try-catch per page in the export loop. Failed pages now get a blank page with error text instead of crashing the entire export. Added retry logic (2 retries) in `captureToCanvas`.  
- **Verification:** Export continues even if one page fails. ✅
